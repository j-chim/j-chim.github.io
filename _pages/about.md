Hi! I am a third year doctoral student at Queen Mary University of London. I work on **natural language processing for mental health applications**, with a focus on **synthetic data generation and evaluation**. More broadly, I'm interested in standardizing and improving the quality of textual data. My long-term goals are to develop fair, human-centered, and privacy-preserving language technologies.

I am supervised by Prof. Maria Liakata, who leads the project: "[Creating time sensitive sensors from language and heterogeneous user generated content](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/time-sensitive-sensing-language-and-user-generated-content)", and jointly supervised by Dr. Julia Ive. My studies are funded by the DeepMind Scholarship. 

I also co-organize the [Data Science for Mental Health Interest Group](https://turing-ds4mh.github.io) at the Alan Turing Institute.
