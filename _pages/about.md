Hi! I am a postdoc at Queen Mary University of London. I work on **natural language processing**, with a focus on **evaluation** and **healthcare applications**. I also co-organize the [Data Science for Mental Health Interest Group](https://turing-ds4mh.github.io) at the Alan Turing Institute.

Previously, I did my MSc at the University of Edinburgh and spent time in various data science/engineering roles in the industry and at the NHS. I did my PhD at QMUL, where I worked on **synthetic data**, **longitudinal NLP**, and **NLP for mental health**, supervised by Prof. Maria Liakata and Dr. Julia Ive. My doctoral studies were funded by the DeepMind scholarship. 

More broadly, I'm interested in tracking and improving data quality. My long-term goals are to develop fair, human-centered, and privacy-preserving language technologies.
