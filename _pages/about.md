I am a first-year doctoral student at [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/). I work on **natural language processing for mental health applications**, with a focus on synthetic data generation and evaluation.

My studies are funded by the [DeepMind Scholarship Programme](https://deepmind.com/scholarships). I am supervised by Prof. Maria Liakata, who leads the [project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/ai-fellows): "Creating time sensitive sensors from language and heterogeneous user generated content". 

Starting in February 2021, I also co-organise the [Data Science for Mental Health Interest Group](turing-ds4mh.github.io) at the Alan Turing Institute, where we run monthly talks and meetings. 

My long-term goals are to develop **fair**, **privacy-preserving**, and **human-centred** language technologies. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my bachelor's degree at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) and my master's degree at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).
