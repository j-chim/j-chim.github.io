Hi! I am an applied researcher working in AI with a focus on NLP. My interests are in evaluation and, more broadly, developing human-centered technologies that can expand how we interact with information and enrich how we think, learn, and collaborate.

I currently work as an AI Scientist in Matillion, developing agent evaluation. I'm also an affiliated researcher at Queen Mary University of London, where I was a postdoc and completed my PhD on synthetic data and evaluation for longitudinal NLP, supported by the DeepMind Scholarship. 

Previously, I did my MSc at the University of Edinburgh, spent time in various data science/engineering roles in the industry and at NHS England, and co-led the Data Science for Mental Health Interest Group at the Alan Turing Institute. [For details, please see my CV](https://j-chim.github.io/cv/).
