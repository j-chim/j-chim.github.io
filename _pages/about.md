I am a first-year doctoral student at Queen Mary University of London. I work on **natural language processing for mental health applications**, with a focus on synthetic data generation and model evaluation.

My studies are funded by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). I am supervised by Prof. Maria Liakata, who leads the [research project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/ai-fellows): "Creating time sensitive sensors from language and heterogeneous user generated content". 

My long-term goals are to develop **fair**, **privacy-preserving**, and **human-centered** language technologies. Broadly speaking, my academic interests include:
* Applied machine learning (healthcare, education)
* Human-Computer Interaction (how users perceive and interact with technology)
* Psycholinguistics (L2 acquisition, multilingualism)
* Integrating explicit and implicit human feedback (e.g., gaze) in NLP 

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my bachelor's degree at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) and my master's degree at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).
